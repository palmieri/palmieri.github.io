A lot of interesting discussions during our <a href="https://motionpredictionicra2024.github.io" target="blank">workshop LHMP at ICRA 2024</a>. I had also the opportunity to present our recent works on context-aware robot navigation at the workshop on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hri-workshop-icra2024/home" target="blank">Supervised autonomy: how to shape human-robot interaction from the body to the brain</a>!!
