During this summer I had the opportunity to give two talks to the students of the University of Stuttgart, invited by <a href="https://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Aiello-00001/" target="blank"> Prof. Aiello</a> and Uni. of Applied Science Konstanz, invited by <a href="https://www.htwg-konstanz.de/hochschule/fakultaeten/informatik/orga/professoren/blaich" target="blank"> Prof. Blaich</a>. It was a great opportunity to talk about my recent research activities!
