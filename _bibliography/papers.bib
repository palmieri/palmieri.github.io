  abstract={We present an ample description of a socially compliant mobile robotic platform, which is developed in the EU-funded project SPENCER. The purpose of this robot is to assist, inform and guide passengers in large and busy airports. One particular aim is to bring travellers of connecting flights conveniently and efficiently from their arrival gate to the passport control. The uniqueness of the project stems from the strong demand of service robots for this application with a large potential impact for the aviation industry on one side, and on the other side from the scientific advancements in social robotics, brought forward and achieved in SPENCER. The main contributions of SPENCER are novel methods to perceive, learn, and model human social behavior and to use this knowledge to plan appropriate actions in real-time for mobile platforms. In this paper, we describe how the project advances the fields of detection and tracking of individuals and groups, recognition of human social relations and activities, normative human behavior learning, socially-aware task and motion planning, learning socially annotated maps, and conducting empirical experiments to assess socio-psychological effects of normative robot behaviors. },

With the goal to speed up planning time, we introduce a learning approach to approximate the distance metric for RRT-based planners. By exploiting a novel steer function which solves the two-point boundary value problem for wheeled mobile robots, we train a simple nonlinear parametric model with constant-time inference that is shown to predict distances accurately in terms of regression and ranking performance. In an extensive analysis we compare our approach to an Euclidean distance baseline, consider four alternative regression models and study the impact of domain-specific feature expansion. The learning approach is shown to be faster in planning time by several factors at negligible loss of path quality.},

  abstract={ Accurate long-term prediction of human motion in populated spaces is an important but difficult task for mobile robots and intelligent vehicles. What makes this task challenging is that human motion is influenced by a large variety of factors including the person's intention, the presence, attributes, actions, social relations and social norms of other surrounding agents, and the geometry and semantics of the environment. In this paper, we consider the problem of computing human motion predictions that account for such factors. We formulate the task as an MDP planning problem with stochastic policies and propose a weighted random walk algorithm in which each agent is locally influenced by social forces from other nearby agents. The novelty of this paper is that we incorporate social grouping information into the prediction process reflecting the soft formation constraints that groups typically impose to their members' motion. We show that our method makes more accurate predictions than three state-of-the-art methods in terms of probabilistic and geometrical performance metrics.},

  abstract={Planning smooth and energy-efficient motions for wheeled mobile robots is a central task in applications ranging from autonomous driving to service and intralogistic robotics. Over the past decades, a wide variety of sampling-based motion planners, extend functions, and path-improvement techniques have been proposed for such systems. Choosing the best combination of components that fit an application is a tedious exercise, even for expert users. With the goal of aiding researchers in designing novel planning algorithms and evaluating path finding solutions, we present Bench-MR: the first open-source sampling-based motion-planning benchmark designed for nonholonomic, wheeled mobile robots. Unlike related benchmarks, Bench-MR offers an extensive number and a variety of algorithm families, post-smoothing techniques, steer functions, optimization criteria, complex environments resembling real-world applications (such as navigating warehouses, moving in cluttered cities and parking) and performance metrics that make it a comprehensive comparison and analysis framework. Bench-MR is easy to use and extend, and, as shown in the detailed examples, it significantly helps practitioners and researchers to analyze and compare their work against the state of the art.},

  pdf={https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9362163},
  abstract={Understanding and anticipating human activity is an important capability for intelligent systems in mobile robotics, autonomous driving, and video surveillance. While learning from demonstrations with on-site collected trajectory data is a powerful approach to discover recurrent motion patterns, generalization to new environments, where sufficient motion data are not readily available, remains a challenge. In many cases, however, semantic information about the environment is a highly informative cue for the prediction of pedestrian motion or the estimation of collision risks. In this work, we infer occupancy priors of human motion using only semantic environment information as input. To this end, we apply and discuss a traditional Inverse Optimal Control approach, and propose a novel approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict future occupancy maps. Our CNN method produces flexible context-aware occupancy estimations for semantically uniform map regions and generalizes well already with small amounts of training data. Evaluated on synthetic and real-world data, it shows superior results compared to several baselines, marking a qualitative step-up in semantic environment assessment.},

With a multitude of new methods proposed by different communities, the lack of standardized benchmarks and objective comparisons is increasingly becoming a major limitation to assess progress and guide further research. Existing benchmarks are limited in their scope and flexibility to conduct relevant experiments and to account for contextual cues of agents and environments. In this paper we present Atlas, a benchmark to systematically evaluate human motion trajectory prediction algorithms in a unified framework. Atlas offers data preprocessing functions, hyperparameter optimization, comes with popular datasets and has the flexibility to setup and conduct underexplored yet relevant experiments to analyze a method's accuracy and robustness. In an example application of Atlas, we compare five popular model- and learning-based predictors and find that, when properly applied, early physics-based approaches are still remarkably competitive. Such results confirm the necessity of benchmarks like Atlas.},

State-of-the-art approaches do not consider cues of human-robot-shared dynamic environments. Aiming to fill this gap, we present a novel Human-Flow-Aware Guided Hierarchical Dyna-Q (HA-GHDQ) algorithm, which solves long-term robot task planning problems by using human motion patterns encoded in Maps of Dynamics (MoDs). To tackle the complexity of long-term robot operation in dynamic environments, we propose a combination of symbolic planning and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) that generates robot policies considering cost information derived from MoDs. We evaluated HA-GHDQ in a factory environment with two simulation and one real-world datasets to complete a transportation-and-assembly task. Our approach outperforms the baselines with respect to sample efficiency and final plan quality. Moreover, we show that it is more adaptable and robust against environmental changes than the baselines.},

Modern approaches to this end require high quality datasets for training and evaluation. However, the majority of available datasets suffers from either inaccurate tracking data or unnatural, scripted behavior of the tracked people. This paper attempts to fill this gap by providing high quality tracking information from motion capture, eye-gaze trackers and on-board robot sensors in a semantically-rich environment. To induce natural behavior of the recorded participants, we utilise loosely scripted task assignment, which induces the participants navigate through the dynamic laboratory environment in a natural and purposeful way. The motion dataset, presented in this paper, sets a high quality standard, as the realistic and accurate data is enhanced with semantic information, enabling development of new algorithms which rely not only on the tracking information but also on contextual cues of the moving agents, static and dynamic environment.},

  abstract={We investigate the task of object goal navigation in unknown environments where the target is specified by a semantic label (e.g. find a couch). Such a navigation task is especially challenging as it requires understanding of semantic context in diverse settings. Most of the prior work tackles this problem under the assumption of a discrete action policy whereas we present an approach with continuous control which brings it closer to real world applications. We propose a deep neural network architecture and loss function to predict dense cost maps that implicitly contain semantic context and guide the robot towards the semantic goal. We also present a novel way of fusing mid-level visual representations in our architecture to provide additional semantic cues for cost map prediction. The estimated cost maps are then used by a sampling-based model predictive controller (MPC) for generating continuous robot actions. The preliminary experiments suggest that the cost maps generated by our network are suitable for the MPC and can guide the agent to the semantic goal more efficiently than a baseline approach. The results also indicate the importance of mid-level representations for navigation by improving the success rate by 7 percentage points.},

  abstract={Robots operating with humans in highly dynamic environments need not only react to moving persons and objects but also to anticipate and adhere to patterns of motion of dynamic agents in their environment. Currently, robotic systems use information about dynamics locally, through tracking and predicting motion within their direct perceptual range. This limits robots to reactive response to observed motion and to short-term predictions in their immediate vicinity. In this paper, we explore how maps of dynamics (MoDs) that provide information about motion patterns outside of the direct perceptual range of the robot can be used in motion planning to improve the behaviour of a robot in a dynamic environment. We formulate cost functions for four MoD representations to be used in any optimizing motion planning framework. Further, to evaluate the performance gain through using MoDs in motion planning, we design objective metrics, and we introduce a simulation framework for rapid benchmarking. We find that planners that utilize MoDs waste less time waiting for pedestrians, compared to planners that use geometric information alone. In particular, planners utilizing both intensity (proportion of observations at a grid cell where a dynamic entity was detected) and direction information have better task execution efficiency.},

Recently, deterministic optimal sampling-based motion planners have been shown to achieve good performance towards this end, in particular in terms of planning efficiency, final solution cost, quality guarantees as well as non-probabilistic completeness. Yet their application is still limited to relatively simple systems (i.e., linear, holonomic, Euclidean state spaces). In this work, we extend this technique to the class of symmetric and optimal driftless systems by presenting Dispertio, an offline dispersion optimization technique for computing sampling sets, aware of differential constraints, for sampling-based robot motion planning. We prove that the approach, when combined with PRM*, is deterministically complete and retains asymptotic optimality.

We propose novel cost and biasing functions for an RRT* planning algorithm, which exploits all the information available in the CLiFF-map model, including uncertainties due to flow variability or partial observability. Qualitatively, a benefit of our approach is that it can also be tuned to yield trajectories with different qualities such as exploratory or cautious, depending on application requirements. Quantitatively, we demonstrate that our approach produces more flow-compliant trajectories, compared to two baselines.},

The proposed Convex Inner ApprOximation (CIAO) method finds a dynamically feasible and collision free trajectory in few iterations, typically one, and preserves feasibility during further iterations. CIAO scales to high-dimensional systems, is computationally efficient, and guarantees both kinodynamic feasibility and continuous-time collision avoidance. Our experimental evaluation shows that the approach outperforms state of the art baselines in terms of planning efficiency and path quality. Furthermore real-world experiments show its capability of unifying trajectory optimization and tracking for safe motion planning in dynamic environments. },

  abstract={Robots have been operating in dynamic environments and shared workspaces for decades. Most optimization based motion planning methods, however, do not consider the movement of other agents, e.g. humans or other robots, and therefore do not guarantee collision avoidance in such scenarios. This paper builds upon the Convex Inner ApprOximation (CIAO) method and proposes a motion planning algorithm that guarantees collision avoidance in predictable dynamic environments. Furthermore, it generalizes CIAO's free region concept to arbitrary norms and proposes a cost function to approximate time optimal motion planning. The proposed method, CIAO*, finds kinodynamically feasible and collision free trajectories for constrained single body robots using model predictive control (MPC). It optimizes the motion of one agent and accounts for the predicted movement of surrounding agents and obstacles. The experimental evaluation shows that CIAO* reaches close to time optimal behavior.},

  abstract={The problem of minimizing cost in nonlinear control systems with uncertainties or disturbances remains a major challenge. Model predictive control (MPC), and in particular sampling-based MPC has recently shown great success in complex domains such as aggressive driving with highly nonlinear dynamics. Sampling-based methods rely on a prior distribution to generate samples in the first place. Obviously, the choice of this distribution highly influences efficiency of the controller. Existing approaches such as sampling around the control trajectory of the previous time step perform suboptimally, especially in multi-modal or highly dynamic settings. In this work, we therefore propose to learn models that generate samples in low-cost areas of the state-space, conditioned on the environment and on contextual information of the task to solve. By using generative models as an informed sampling distribution, our approach exploits guidance from the learned models and at the same time maintains robustness properties of the MPC methods. We use Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to learn distributions that imitate samples from a training dataset containing optimized controls. An extensive evaluation in the autonomous navigation domain suggests that replacing previous sampling schemes with our learned models considerably improves performance.},
