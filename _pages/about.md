I am a group leader and research scientist at [Robert Bosch GmbH Corporate Research](https://www.bosch.com/research/){:target="\_blank"}, where I work on artificial intelligence methods that enable autonomous agents, such as autonomous driving cars and robots, to learn and generate complex behaviors.

I earned my PhD with focus on robot planning, control and learning at [Uni Freiburg](https://www.tf.uni-freiburg.de/de){:target="\_blank"}, [Social Robotics Laboratory](http://srl.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/){:target="\_blank"}. I obtained my Master and Bachelor degrees in computer engineering at the [Università degli Studi della Campania, Luigi Vanvitelli](https://international.unicampania.it/index.php/en/){:target="\_blank"}. 

**Research Interests**

My wish is to commit and to contribute to the technological, social and economical progress of our society, by developing novel AI and robotics technologies  that can improve and be integral part of our daily life. 

In particular, I am interested in developing AI algorithms for smart autonomous decision making under uncertainty for single and multi-agent systems, such as: human behavior, activitiy and motion prediction, also using vision-language models; behavior learning in dynamic environments, reinforcement learning, hybrid systems of learning-planning-control.


**Academic Service** 

I’m a co-organizer of the [Long-term Human Motion Prediction series of workshops](https://motionpredictionicra2021.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}, organizer and associate editor of the [Special Issue on Long-term Human Motion Prediction on the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l/special-issues/cfp-special-long-term-human-motion-prediction){:target="\_blank"}, served as associate editor for ICRA and PC/reviewer for: ICRA, IROS, RA-L, TRO, AAAI, and various ML/AI workshops.
